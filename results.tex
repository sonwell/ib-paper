\section{Numerical results}

Here we describe two types of test: unstructured IB points, in which points are placed
randomly in the domain and generate a force independently from the other IB points, and
structured IB points, in which the points comprise an elastic structure and forces are
generated based on the configuration of the points as a whole. For these tests, we use
a $16\um\times16\um\times16\um$ triply periodic domain with an initially shear-like flow,
$\u=(0,\,0,\,\shear(y-8\um))$, with shear rate $\shear$. Tests use a shear rate of
$1000\si{\per\second}$ unless otherwise noted. This flow has a sharp transition at the
periodic boundary $y=0\um$, so a background force is added to maintain this transition
and so that the initial flow is also the steady flow in the absence of other forces, as
in \cite{Fai:2013do}.

Serial and multicore CPU tests were performed on a single node with 48 Intel{\reg}
Xeon{\reg} CPU E5-2697 v2 2.70\si{\giga\hertz} processors and 256 GB of RAM running
CentOS Linux release 7.7.1908 (x86\_64). Parallel CPU implementations use Intel's OpenMP
library, \texttt{libiomp5}. GPU tests used the same node with an NVIDIA{\reg} Tesla{\reg}
K80 ($2\times$GK210 GPU with 13 823.5\si{\mega\hertz} multiprocessors and 12 GB of global
memory each). Only one of the GK210 GPUs was used. The CPU code was written in C++17 and
the GPU code was written in C++/CUDA and used version 9.2 CUDA libraries. Both the CPU
and GPU code were compiled using \texttt{clang} version 7.0.1. All tests are performed in
double precision. We begin with tests using unstructured IB points, for which both of
these architectures were used.

\subsection{Unstructured IB points}\label{sec:unst}

Consider a set of $n$ IB points randomly placed in the domain described above. The IB
points are imagined to be tethered to their initial positions. The fluid solver is not
invoked for these tests. Instead, at each timestep, we interpolate the fluid velocity to
each of the IB points and predict updated positions for the IB points. Using these
predicted positions, we compute a Hookean force for each IB point with spring constant
$0.01\si{dyn\per\centi\meter}$. We spread these forces from the predicted positions to
the fluid grid, but do not use them to update the fluid velocity. This ensures that the
points do not settle into a steady position so the spreading and interpolation operations
receive new data each timestep. Finally, we interpolate the velocity to the positions of
the IB points at the beginning of the timestep again and update the position of the IB
points. While the interpolated velocities are the same as those computed at the beginning
of the timestep, this is done by analogy to the fluid solver, which interpolates fluid
velocities twice and spreads forces once per timestep.

We use this test to compare the performance of the parallel algorithms to their serial
counterparts and, for the spreading variants, to each other.

\subsection{Elastic Objects}

We are motivated by the desire to simulate the motion of cells immersed in a fluid. Cells
are not randomly generated points, but cohesive structures, kept together by elastic
forces and the near-constant volume enclosed by their membranes. In this section, we
replace the randomly-placed IB points with points sampled on the surface of either a
sphere or an RBC. We track $n_d$ data sites per object, and interpolate fluid velocities
only to these points. We construct an RBF interpolant based on the positions of the data
sites and evaluate forces at $n_s$ sample sites, chosen so that neighboring sample sites
are initially within approximately $0.5h$ of each other. We spread forces from the sample
sites. It is generally the case that $n_s > n_d$, so that we interpolate to fewer points
than we spread from. In the parlance of Section \ref{sec:parallel}, $n_\gamma=n_d$ in the
context of interpolation, and $n_\gamma=n_s$ in the context of spreading. These point
sets are generated by the \texttt{KernelNode} library. In this case, we invoke the fluid
solver, so that as the object deforms, the force it imparts on the fluid will affect the
fluid velocity. The sphere and RBC are elastic, obeying the Skalak constitutive law
\cite{Skalak:1973tp} with shear modulus $2.5\times10^{-3}\dynpercm$ and bulk modulus
$2.5\times10^{-1}\dynpercm$. The RBC has rest configuration given in \cite{Omori:2012hw}:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        x(\theta,\,\varphi) &= R_0\cos\theta\cos\varphi, \\
        y(\theta,\,\varphi) &= R_0\sin\theta\cos\varphi, \\
        z(\theta,\,\varphi) &= \sfrac12 R_0\sin\varphi\left[0.21 + 2.0 \cos^2\varphi -1.12 \cos^4\varphi\right],
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $R_0=3.91\um$, $\theta\in[-\pi,\,\pi)$, and $\varphi\in[-\pi/2,\,\pi/2]$. These
tests require a timestep of $k=0.1\us$ for stability. With $\shear=1000\si{\per\second}$,
an IB point requires at least 32 timesteps to transit a grid cell, so unlike the tests
using randomly placed IB points above, there will be considerably more redundant
computation. We first validate the fluid solver with the elastic sphere before performing
scaling tests, similar to those above, with RBCs.
