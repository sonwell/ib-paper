\section{Summary} \label{sec:summary}

We presented a parallel algorithm for interpolation and introduced a novel parallel
algorithm for spreading forces from time-dependent interfaces in the immersed boundary
method. These algorithms have a runtime that is independent of the Eulerian grid. This
makes the parallelization useful for cases where IB points inhabit only a small
percentage of the Eulerian grid cells. We also introduced two variants for spread which
trade off dependence on the Eulerian grid, in the form of a few vector adds and memory
allocation, for improved runtimes for small enough grids.

These algorithms exhibit nearly ideal scaling, on both the CPU and GPU, for problems of
fixed size and increasing number of threads, as well as for problems of increasing size
and number of threads.  We observed that on the GPU, larger problem sizes led to higher
speedup plateaus, indicating that larger problems on more capable hardware will achieve
even larger speedups than presented here.

This work does not consider how our algorithms will perform on multi-node systems, though
we anticipate they will perform well as they do not rely on partitioning the Eulerian or
Lagrangian points. Because information about the Eulerian grid is encoded by the
functions $\key$ and $\#$, an optimized distributed-memory algorithm may need to use a
different $\key$ or $\#$ function on each node, to account for Eulerian grid
partitioning. As simulations become more computationally intensive, such algorithms will
become more necessary. To that end, future work involves adapting our algorithms for
multi-node and multi-GPU systems.
