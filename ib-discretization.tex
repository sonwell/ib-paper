\subsection{Preliminaries}

For a regular grid on $\domain$ with grid spacing $h$, $\domain_h$, any grid point
$\x\in\domain_h$ can be decomposed into a vector $\vec{i}$ with integer components and a
fixed grid staggering, $\stag\in[0,\,1)^d$, such that $\x=h(\vec{i}+\stag)$. Let
$\interface_h$ be a discretization of the interface $\interface$. For the purposes of
interpolation and spreading, we can think of $\interface_h$ as a collection of arbitrary
points in $\domain$.

The kernel $\Dirac_h$ is the tensor product of scaled, one-dimensional kernels,
$h^{-1}\kernel(h^{-1}x)$. Let $\supp\kernel$ denote the support of $\kernel$ and define
\begin{equation}
    s[\kernel] = |\supp\kernel\cap\mathbb{Z}|-1
\end{equation}
to be the size of the support in terms of unit intervals. For brevity, we write
$s=s[\kernel]$. For any $\X\in\domain$, there are at most $s^d$ grid points
$\x\in\domain_h$ for which $\Dirac_h(\x-\X)$ is nonzero. We call these points the
\term{support points} of $\X$. If $\X$ is sufficiently far from any boundary, the subset
of $\domain$ each of whose points has the same support points as $\X$ is an
$h^d=h\times\cdots\times h$ region, and contains a single grid point. For $\X$ near a
non-periodic boundary, the region may be smaller, and may not contain a grid point. We
extend the grid so that each of these regions has side length $h$ in each dimension and
contains a single grid point.  We call this extension $\bar{\domain}_h$. Collectively,
these regions cover $\domain$, so we consider them to be the \emph{de facto} grid cells,
and henceforth refer to them as such. We can now identify any $\X\in\domain$ with a grid
point $\x\in\bar{\domain}_h$ if they are in the same grid cell, and since
$\x=h(\vec{i}+\stag)$ is the only grid point in the grid cell, we identify the cell by
the integers $\vec{i}$. We adopt the notation $\idx{\X}=\vec{i}$ for the function that
maps points in $\domain$ to the vector of integers identifying the grid cell containing
$\X$.

We now turn our attention to the evaluation of $\Dirac_h(\x-\X)$. We assume
$\x\in\domain_h$ and write
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:delta-defs}
    \begin{aligned}
        \Dirac_h(\x-\X)
        &= \Dirac_h(\x-h(\idx{\X}+\stag) + h(\idx{\X}+\stag) - \X) \\
        &\equiv \Dirac_h(h\shift - \Delta\x) \\
        &= \prod_{i=1}^d h^{-1}\kernel((\shift - h^{-1}\Delta\x)_i),
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta\x = \X-h(\idx{\X}+\stag)$ is the displacement of $\X$ from its associated
grid point, $\shift=\idx{\x}-\idx{\X}$, and subscript $i$ denotes the $i$ component. We
refer to $\shift$ as a \term{shift}. Shifts that result in a possibly nonzero value of
$\Dirac_h$ are known \emph{a priori} based on the kernel $\kernel$, and usually range
from $-\floor{s/2}$ to $\floor{(s-1)/2}$ in each component. We can therefore assign an
order to the shifts, $\shift_1$, $\shift_2$, \dots, $\shift_{s^d}$. We need only compute
$\Delta\x$ once to be able to compute all nonzero values of $\Dirac_h(\x-\X)$.

We need one more ingredient to construct $\spread$. We let $\x_k$ be the be the $k\th$
grid point, and for Eulerian function $e(\x)$, we construct the vector $\vec{e}$ with
$k\th$ entry $e_k = e(\x_k)$. Define the \term{grid indexing function}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:grid-index-fn}
    \#(\vec{i}) = \begin{cases}
        k, & \idx{\x_k}=\vec{i},\ \x_k\in\domain_h \\
        \error, & \text{otherwise}.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
The value $\error$ indicates an Eulerian point outside of $\domain$, does not have a
corresponding row in $\spread$, and therefore does not contribute to spreading or
interpolation. We are now ready to construct $\spread$. Let $\X_j$ be an IB
point. The $j\th$ column of $\mathcal{S}$ is zero except for up to $s^d$ values where,
for $i=1,\,\ldots,\,s^d$, if $\#(\idx{\X_j}+\shift_i)\neq\error$,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:s-columnwise}
    \spread_{\#\left(\idx{\X_j}+\shift_i\right),j} = \Dirac_h\left(h\left(\shift_i+\idx{\X_j}+\stag\right)-\X_j\right).
\end{equation}
From a practicality standpoint, it is unnecessary to explicitly construct $\spread$. We
illustrate this with the serial spreading algorithm.
