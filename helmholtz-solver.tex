\subsection{Helmholtz solver}

To solve the Helmholtz system $\tilde{I}-\sfrac12\lambda\Delta_h$, we use
conjugate gradients preconditioned with Chebyshev iteration. Chebyshev
iteration requires only that the matrix be positive (negative) semi-definite,
and uses only matrix-vector multiplication and vector scaling, it is
parallelizable if those two operations are. Vector scaling is trivially
parallelilzable, and for certain matrix formats, such as compressed sparse row,
matrix-vector multiplication is parallelizable as well.
