\section{Parallelization strategies for interpolation and spreading} \label{sec:parallel}

Here, we describe a method for evaluating the discrete counterparts to
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:scalar-interp}
    E(\X) &= \int_\domain \Dirac_h(\x-\X)e(\x) \d\omega \quad \text{and}\\
    \label{eq:scalar-spread}
    \ell(\x) &= \int_\interface \Dirac_h(\x-\X)L(\X) \d\gamma
\end{align}
where scalar-valued Eulerian function $e:\domain\to\mathbb{R}$ is interpolated to
Lagrangian point $\X$ and Lagrangian function $L:\interface\to\mathbb{R}$ is spread to
Eulerian point $\x$. For vector-valued functions, such as the Eulerian fluid velocity
$\u$ and Lagrangian force $\F$, the algorithm can be applied to each component
individually. For a staggered grid, this is necessary, as the grid for each component has
a different set of grid points, and may have a different number of grid points. In the
following, we discuss parallelizing equation \eqref{eq:scalar-interp} and introduce a
novel parallelization scheme for evaluating equation \eqref{eq:scalar-spread}. We begin
by defining some notation that will be used throughout the description of these
algorithms.
