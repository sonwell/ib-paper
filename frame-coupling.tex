\section{Eulerian-Lagrangian frame coupling}

Here, we describe a method for approximating
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:scalar-interp}
    E(\vec{X}) &= \int_\domain \delta_h(\vec{x}-\vec{X})e(\vec{x}) \d\omega \quad \text{and}\\
    \label{eq:scalar-spread}
    \ell(\vec{x}) &= \int_\interface \delta_h(\vec{x}-\vec{X})L(\vec{X}) \d\gamma
\end{align}
where scalar-valued Eulerian function $e:\domain\to\mathbb{R}$ is interpolated
to Lagrangian point $\X$ and Lagrangian function $L:\interface\to\mathbb{R}$ is
spread to Eulerian point $\x$. For vector-valued functions, such as $\vec{u}$
and $\vec{F}$, the algorithm can be applied to each component individually. For
a staggered grid, this is necessary, as the grid for each component has a
different set of grid points, and may have a different number of grid points.
We then discuss parallelizing equation \eqref{eq:scalar-interp} and introduce a
novel parallelization scheme for evaluating equation \eqref{eq:scalar-spread}.
