\subsection{Poisson solver}

Chebyshev iteration can also be modified for use as a smoother/relaxer for
multigrid. Its efficacy is comparable or better to that of successive
over-relaxation (SOR), but the parallelism of Chebyshev iteration far exceeds
that of SOR. To solve the Poisson problem for $\phi$, we employ multigrid with
a Chebyshev smoother as a preconditioner for conjugate gradients.
