\subsubsection{Convergence study}
To test the convergence of the fluid solver and cell representation, consider 
an object that obeys Skalak's law with the coefficients given above and is
spherical at rest. Deform the object from its rest configuration by stretching
it by a factor of $1.1$ in the $z$ direction and compressing it by a factor of
$1.1$ in the $y$ direction to maintain a fixed volume. For this test, $\shear$
is zero, so the fluid velocity is intially zero, and the object tends toward
its rest configuration over the course of simulation. We allow the object to
relax for $16\us$, and compare errors generated by successive grid refinements
of 16, 32, 64, and 128 points per $16\um$. For each grid, we use a fixed set of
$n_d=625$ data sites, sampled approximately uniformly on the surface of the
sphere, and choose $n_s$ so that sample sites are approximately uniform and
roughly $h/1.1$ apart, so that sample sites are roughly $h$ apart initially.
For $h=1\um$, $n_s=220$, and a refinement by a factor of 2 increases $n_s$ by a
factor of 4, for a maximum number of 14080 sample sites for these tests. A thin
interface which generates a force will cause a jump in the normal stress across
the interface, which the IB method may not recover. We therefore anticipate
first order convergence for the fluid velocity and data site positions.

Tables \ref{tab:u-convergence} and \ref{tab:x-convergence} show the convergence
of fluid velocity and data sites, respectively. To compute errors in the fluid
velocity, we construct a cubic spline from the velocities on the finer grid
and evaluate the spline at the grid points of the coarser grid. Each of the
interfaces is constructed with the same number of data sites, so the
coordinates from one simulation to another can be compared directly. We recover
approximately first order convergence for both fluid velocity and data sites
positions. Having established asymptotic convergence of our IB solver, we
continue by performing scaling tests with RBCs.
